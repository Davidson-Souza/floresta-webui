This repository contains (TODO) a small web-ui for controlling [Floresta](https://github.com/vinteumorg/floresta). With this UI, you can see stats about your node, add new wallets, explore blocks and so on.

It will be particularly useful for node-in-box solutions that usually centralize everything with web applications running on a separate device.

Goals:
 - Simple, low dependency and stable
 - Expose most of `floresta`'s functionalities with a nice UX
 - Be easy to run

Features:
 - [ ] Stats about your node, like uptime, resource usage, best chain, number of peers, etc
 - [ ] A way to add new descriptors/xpubs to watch
 - [ ] Browse your transactions
 - [ ] Scan for a particular address
 - [ ] See what's inside blocks (a simple block explorer)
 - [ ] Export a QR code with the `assumeutreexo` values, so you can setup other instances of floresta
 - [ ] more...
